Terminator Manual (GTK2)
========================

Fully fleshed-out manual for Terminator.

The main Terminator icon was created by Cory Kontros, and provided under the `CC-BY-SA`_ licence.

This Manual and included images are wholly new pieces created by the current maintainer Steve Boddy, and are distributed under the `CC-BY-SA`_ licence, as are the horrific attempts by yours truly at using Cory’s icon to provide page identities.

How to Build
------------

* Install the shinx package and the ReadTheDocs theme `pip install sphinx sphinx-rtd-theme` 
* Clone this repository
* ``cd docs``
* Build the HTML pages ``make html``
* serve up the web pages: ``cd _build/html && python -m SimpleHTTPServer 4000``
* Review the results at http://localhost:4000
